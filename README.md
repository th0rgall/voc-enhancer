# Vocabulary.com Enhancer

This browser extension for Firefox/Chrome allows [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/) users to add words from any web page to their vocabulary lists. It also offers translations to any language in the world learning game and links to clarifying services like Google Images or the Urban Dictionary. 

## Installation

Install via your browser's extension store:
- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/diddacjdgklfjgnlmknacnakjcgdiegn)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vocabulary-com-enhancer/)

## Usage

**Adding words**

Select a word or range of words on any website, right click, and you'll be able to:
- Start learning the selected word(s)
- Add the word(s) to one of your lists (they will appear in a dropdown menu)
- Add the word(s) to a new list.

The surrounding sentence of the world will automatically be picked up, and listed as a source of the word in vocabulary.com. This also works on Firefox for Android, using a pop-up after selection instead of the Android context menu.

**Seeing translations**

Translations automatically show up in the word learning game and on definition pages. Click the language abbreviation to change language.

**Useful side links**

The extension automatically adds links to services like Google Images, YouGlish, GIPHY, ... to further understand words. They appear in the word learning game explanations, in words lists and on definition pages.

**Examples in the word game**

If training a specific list (assignment), the user-created examples of that list will be shown in the explanation.

## Roadmap

- Selecting the specific meaning of a word to be saved 
- A good word definition viewer
- A notepad to add multiple words with example sentences, by just typing.
